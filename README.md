# run_analysis.R

The following Steps show how the Run_Analysis works:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one dataset.

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measure

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names

5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
